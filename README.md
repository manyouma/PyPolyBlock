A clear and simple object-oriented Python and NumPy implementation of monotonic optimiztion and the polyblock outer approximation (POA) algorithm. For more details of the POA algorithm, please refer to:

[1] Zhang, Ying Jun Angela, Liping Qian, and Jianwei Huang. "Monotonic optimization in communication and networking systems." Foundations and TrendsÂ® in Networking 7.1 (2013): 1-75. 

To get started, run 
```
python main.py
```

Please feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions to make the code faster or more robust.
